INSTRUCTIONS AND SACRIFICES (HOW TO INCREASE MY CAPACITY)

- John 12:49, this was the template of Jesus.
- If you want to say you are spiritual what were you commanded to say and speak
- Those who are obedient does not make you talk too much, that means God does not repeat instructions to Jesus
- Most of the times God just speaks simple, short and brief - Matthew 3:16-17, John 12:28-29
- My capacity is according to the instructions I follow, it will only increase by the instructions we follow
- Capacity will also increase by the sacrifices I make
- Most instructions we receive might not produce an instantenoius tesimony, but not following it at all will just close the door to the next testimony
- There are testimonies you will not be able to retain because of your level of the Word of God, because you refused to grow in Life Class
- The challenges you overcome is what prepares your capacity for the heights you want to get to - so God uses challenges to prepare us to increase in capacity
- God uses every betrayal to take you to the next level
- Where are the challenges you have overcome, not that youwill be expecting billions to come from no where 
- Sometimes God uses your feelings to increase your capacity (start praying when you feel sad)
- 2 Kings 4:18-37, as a Leader anything that wants to happen I must see it, but seeing in itself is a capacity, revelation is capacity. But what will happen when you don't see it? 
- Prayers bring Revelations, there are two kinds of prayers - Kingdom Prayers and Egypt Prayers
- My revelations are my capacity, I must be concerned when I don't see because the devil is always planning
- When you relate with God, He will talk to you 
- As a business person, use revelations to make profit
